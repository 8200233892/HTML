<!-- Void elements in HTML are elements that do not have a closing tag. They are
self-closing, meaning the entire element is contained within a single tag, and
no separate closing tag is needed. Void elements are used to insert specific
types of content or objects into a document, and they do not have any content or
text between opening and closing tags. -->
