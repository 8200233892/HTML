<!-- HTML tags are used to hold the HTML element. HTML element holds the content.
HTML attributes are used to describe the characteristic of an HTML element in
detail. HTML tag starts with < and ends with > Whatever written within a HTML
tag are HTML elements

[01]Tags:

Tags are the building blocks of HTML and are used to define different elements on a web page.
They are enclosed in angle brackets < > and come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The content is placed between these tags.
Example: <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

[02]Attributes:

Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and are always included in the opening tag.
They are made up of a name and a value, separated by an equal sign.
In this example, href is the attribute name, and "https://www.example.com" is the attribute value.
Here are a few common HTML tags:

<p>: Paragraph
<h1>, <h2>, ..., <h6>: Headings (from largest to smallest)
<a>: Anchor (used for hyperlinks)
<img>: Image
<ul>, <ol>, <li>: Unordered list, Ordered list, List item
<div>: Division (used for grouping and styling)
<span>: Inline container (used for styling)
And some common HTML attributes:

src: Specifies the source URL for elements like <img> (e.g., <img src="image.jpg">).
href: Specifies the URL for hyperlinks (e.g., <a href="https://www.example.com">Link</a>).
alt: Provides alternative text for images (e.g., <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">).
class: Assigns a class to an HTML element, used for styling with CSS (e.g., <div class="container">).
id: Assigns a unique identifier to an HTML element (e.g., <div id="uniqueID">).
Understanding how to use tags and attributes is fundamental to creating structured and well-formed HTML documents. -->
