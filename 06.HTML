<!-- 
In HTML, the class attribute is used to assign one or more class names to an
HTML element. The class attribute allows you to apply styles or behavior to
multiple elements with the same class. This is a key aspect of using Cascading
Style Sheets (CSS) to style web pages.
Here, tagname is the HTML tag name (e.g.,
<div>, <p>, <span>), and "classname" is the name of the class or a
space-separated list of multiple class names.

In this example, the class attribute is set to "highlight," which
means you can define specific styles for elements with the class
"highlight" in your CSS stylesheet.This allows for better
organization and reusability of styles across different elements on
 a web page.
 The class attribute is not limited to styling; it can
also be used for JavaScript interaction, where elements with a
specific class can be selected and manipulated dynamically using
JavaScript code. -->
