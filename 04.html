<!-- HTML entities are special codes or sequences used to represent characters that
have a specific meaning in HTML or characters that are not easily typable on a
standard keyboard. HTML entities are typically used to ensure that certain
characters are displayed correctly in web pages and to avoid conflicts with HTML
markup.

HTML entities are composed of an ampersand (&), followed by a specific code or
name, and ending with a semicolon (;). The general syntax is &entity_name; or
&#entity_number;.

Here are a few examples of HTML entities:

[1]&lt; - Represents the less-than symbol <.
[2]&gt; - Represents the greater-than symbol >.
[3]&amp; - Represents the ampersand &.
[4]&quot; - Represents the double quotation mark " (useful inside attribute
values).
[5]&apos; - Represents the apostrophe (single quotation mark) ' (not supported
in
all browsers; use &lsquo; and &rsquo; for left and right single quotes). -->
