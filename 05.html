<!-- (1)Unordered List (<ul>):

    An unordered list is used to represent a list of items with no specific
    order or sequence.
    Each item is typically marked with a bullet point.
    The <ul> element is used to define the unordered list, and each list item is
        represented by the <li> element.
            <ul>
                <li>Item 1</li>
                <li>Item 2</li>
                <li>Item 3</li>
            </ul>
(2) Ordered List (<ol>):

     An ordered list is used to represent a list of items with a
     specific order or sequence, typically numbered.
     The <ol> element is used to define the ordered list, and each
         list item is represented by the <li> element.
            <ol>
                <li>First item</li>
                <li>Second item</li>
                <li>Third item</li>
              </ol> -->
