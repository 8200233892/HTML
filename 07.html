<!-- (1)id Attribute:

The id attribute is used to uniquely identify a single HTML element on a page.
No two elements on the same page should have the same id.
It is often used when a specific element requires unique styling or when
scripting (JavaScript) needs to interact with a particular element.

(2)class Attribute:

The class attribute is used to group and apply styles to multiple HTML elements.
Multiple elements on a page can share the same class.
It is commonly used to style elements consistently or to select and manipulate
multiple elements using CSS or JavaScript.

Key Differences:

Uniqueness:

The id attribute must be unique within a page. No two elements can have the same
id.
The class attribute can be shared among multiple elements on the same page.

Purpose:

The id attribute is used to uniquely identify a specific element, often for
styling or scripting purposes.
The class attribute is used to group multiple elements together, allowing them
to share common styles or be selected collectively.
Styling and Scripting:

The id attribute is typically used when applying styles or scripting to a
specific, unique element.
The class attribute is used when applying styles or scripting to a group of
related elements.
In summary, use the id attribute when you need a unique identifier for a
specific element, and use the class attribute when you want to apply common
styles or behavior to multiple elements. -->
